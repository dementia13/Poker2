# Poker2

A poker game in Java. Generates a shuffled deck, deals hands to a specified number of "players", and displays the winning hand.

This is a light amusement and mainly exists as a programming exercise. It's a demonstration of my work, so if you would like to contribute, I prefer that you simply fork the project, clone it to your own directory, and credit me where appropriate. This is licensed GPL3.

The original jPoker is a port from a command-line C program. Much of the code is procedural in nature. This is intended as a fully object-oriented update. The calculation system is to be simplified for maintainability and efficiency. All classes are to be subjected to mechanized testing.
